# Password Generator

Creating an application that generates a random password (8-128 characters)at the click of a button. The password will be created based on the user's answer to prompts.

This time around, I really struggled with the javascript. I know what I wanted my code to do, but struggled to lay it out step by step via javascript. I look at the code and feel like it could be drier, but also at the same time, it seems like the code I have currently is not enough (and doesn't... work)
