# Password Generator

Creating an application that generates a random password (8-128 characters)at the click of a button. The password will be created based on the user's answer to prompts.

This time around, I really struggled with the javascript. I know what I wanted my code to do, but struggled to lay it out step by step via javascript. I look at the code and feel like it could be drier.

Revision: After many many videos and furious googling, I HAVE COMPLETED THE CODE! What had me stuck for a while was the "undefined" that was generating into the password box along with my random password, but I figured it out. 

Still not the best with javascript, but at least I do understand it more now.
